# points-in-triangle

A node.js library helping you to process all rasterized points in any 2D triangle.

## How does it work?

* Implementation of [Bresenham Triangle Rasterization](http://www.sunshine2k.de/coding/java/TriangleRasterization/TriangleRasterization.html#algo3)
* Triangle sides are determined using [bresenham](https://github.com/madbence/node-bresenham)
* All points in the triangle are iterated and passed to the callback.

## How to install

Install it into your project with
```
npm install --save points-in-triangle
```

## How to use it

```js
const pointsInTriangle = require('points-in-triangle');
pointsInTriangle([[0, 0], [4, 4], [4, 0]], (x, y) => console.log(x, y));
```
