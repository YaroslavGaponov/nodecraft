# points-in-polygon

A node.js library helping you to process all rasterized points in any 2D polygon.

## How does it work?

* Triangulation is done via [earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut)
* Points in the resulting triangles are determined using co-project [points-in-triangle](https://github.com/rastapasta/points-in-triangle)
* All points in the polygon are iterated and passed to the callback.

## What is it for?

* Rendering: Draw any given polygon!
* GIS: Create height maps of 2D shape files!

## How to install

Install it into your project with
```
npm install --save points-in-polygon
```

## How to use it

```js
const pointsInPolygon = require('points-in-polygon');

// Format: [[[outerX,outerY],...],[[innerX,innerY],...],[[innerX,innerY],...]]
let polygon = [
  // first element is defining the outer area of the polygon
  [[0, 0], [10, 0], [10, 10], [0, 10]],
  // following elements will define the inner cut out areas
  [[3, 3], [6, 3], [6, 6], [3, 6]],
  ...
];
// triangulate, rasterize and calculate points inside the polygon
pointsInPolygon(polygon, (x, y) => console.log(x, y));
```
